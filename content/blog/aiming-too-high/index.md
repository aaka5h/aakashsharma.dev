I started my professional dev career about 3 years back, since day 1. I wanted to have a website that brings me to the
internet, a simple website that more than anyone I liked the most.

Jump forward to today no progress I still don't have a website. I have tried building in past years, have ideas build
some part of it, and then nothing came out of it. So I took a step back and asked what I really wanted. It came down to
two things:

- have a site that at least loads something
- have content on it that I have written

Then everything came next: SEO, responsiveness, load times, build times, how it looks etc.

The problem I had with me was that my site should look like the end product that I wanted from the beginning, that's
aiming too high. Working in a professional environment made me realise that nothing is build in a day (everybody knows
this, but still)
and big goals needs to broken into small achievable ones. The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.

Now, I have decided to start with a simple gatsby template that gives me a base to start working from and go forward. So
here I am today writing my first piece of text, and if you are reading this means that I am one step closer now, and I
will be making this space to final vision of mine one step at a time.

Thanks for reading âœŒ !
